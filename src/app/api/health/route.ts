 * for something to look up.
 *
 * This exists because "the site returns 200" says nothing about *which build*
 * is serving. Render keeps the previous version live when a build fails, so a
 * healthy response is exactly what a failed deploy looks like from outside.
 * That cost us a run of deploys that looked fine and were not.
